SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
The increase of social media platforms and online forums has led to an explosion of textual data expressing opinions, emotions, and sentiments. Understanding the sentiment behind this massive volume of text has become essential for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers to gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and market trends. Sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task, plays a pivotal role in automatically categorizing text data into sentiment classes, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
The system focuses on the development and evaluation of a sentiment analysis system using supervised machine learning techniques. We leverage the power of machine learning models to classify text data based on the sentiment expressed within it. By automating sentiment analysis, system aims to provide a valuable tool for businesses and organizations to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

<h3>Findings</h3>

based on the accuracy comparison of same dataset but different no of entries (0 to 100, 0 to 500, 0 to 1000, 0 to 5000, 0 to 10000, 0 to 50000 and 0 to 70000), it appears that for the Tweet dataset Random Forest is giving the highest accuracy with the range of (0.84 - 0.92) or (84 - 92 %) hence the RandomForest algorithm will use for the Sentiment Analysis.
